Executable: out/thread
Caution!! Before producing the final result, the program will "get stuck" for a while. DO NOT KILL THE PROCESS OR REBOOT OR UNPLUG THE POWER OF YOUR COMPUTER! This is intentional! And this is NOT A BUG. Repeat. This is NOT A BUG!

Usage: ./thread
You will see the desired output: the three 5x5 matrices and the max row sum of matrix C. The program uses slow matrix multiplication.

No memory leak. No known bugs. 


[mysh]
Executable: out/mysh
Usage: ./mysh

All functionality implemented. For support of history, "history" command is stored but other shortcuts starts with "!" are not (avoid recursive call)".

There are memory leaks detected. Freed as much as possible. Obviously there's more. May due to some improper use of lib functions??

No known bugs.
